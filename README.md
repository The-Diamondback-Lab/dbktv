## Getting Started

Located in College Park, Maryland, The Diamondback is the University of
Maryland's student run newspaper.

DiamondbackTV (DBKTV) is a digital signage project with the goal of streaming

previews, and advertisements - to various televisions on campus.

### Design

A prototype of the project can be viewed at [this link][1].

## Usage

After running `npm install`, run `npm start` to serve and test the Firebase
project locally. If successfull, you'll see the following in your terminal:

```bash
The project was built assuming it is hosted at the server root.
You can control this with the homepage field in your package.json.
For example, add this to build it for GitHub Pages:

  "homepage" : "http://myname.github.io/myapp",

The build folder is ready to be deployed.
You may serve it with a static server:

  serve -s build
