  "blurb": "University of Maryland students asked College Park’s three mayoral candidates questions about issues such as affordable housing and the recently-passed nuisance ordinance at a forum Monday night in the Stamp Student Union.\n\nAbout 25 students showed up to the Student Government Association-hosted event, which comes about a week before the city’s elections. After opening statements from the candidates and a couple questions from the event moderator, attendees took pieces of white paper that were sitting on their chairs and wrote questions.\n\nIncumbent Patrick Wojahn and mayoral hopeful Lalzarliani Malsawma both said they thought housing affordability was the most important issue facing students."
