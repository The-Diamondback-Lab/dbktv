  "body": "Less than two weeks before it was scheduled to begin, the trial for the former University of Maryland student charged with murder and a hate crime in the death of 2nd. Lt. Richard Collins has been delayed for a fourth time.\n\nJudge Lawrence Hill granted Sean Urbanski’s lawyers’ motion for more time Thursday, Prince George’s County State’s Attorney’s Office spokesperson Denise Roberts told The Diamondback. The trial will now begin Dec. 9, she said.\n\nThe defense claimed they needed more time for an expert to sort through evidence from Urbanski’s cell phone, Roberts said. Last month, Hill ruled that evidence — which included racist memes — was admissible in court, despite Urbanski’s lawyers’ efforts to bar it."
