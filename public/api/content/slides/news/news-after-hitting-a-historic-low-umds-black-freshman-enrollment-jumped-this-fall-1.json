  "blurb": "After hitting a near three-decade low, enrollment of black freshmen at the University of Maryland saw a marked increase this fall, according to recently released data from the Institutional Research, Planning and Assessment office.\n\nAfrican American students now make up just over 11 percent of this university’s freshman class. Last year, they made up just 7.3 percent — the lowest proportion since 1992, when the office first started keeping track.\n\nOverall, though, black freshman enrollment has been trending downward since 2006, and this year’s percentage is still the fourth-lowest the university has had."
