  "blurb": "When Maryland field hockey stepped out for its game against Michigan State, Emma DeBerdine strutted around the middle of the park, eventually slotting into the midfield and scoring from there in the second period.\n\nJoining her in the midfield was Kelee Lepage — a player who spent much of her first three seasons as a key cog in the Terps’ defensive unit. And 25 yards in front of the pair stood Madison Maguire, a midfielder by trade who coach Missy Meharg moved up the pitch before the season to increase Maryland’s scoring output.\n\nThe trio is part of the bevy of changes Meharg has made to the lineup, pushing players to show off their versatility and fill in positions that may not be natural to them."
