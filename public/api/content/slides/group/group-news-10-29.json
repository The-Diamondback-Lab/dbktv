She thought talking to a psychologist could help.\n\nBut the doctor seemed to question her, Williams said, and told her if she was so anxious, it would probably be easier not to come out at all.\n\n“Maybe I should just hide this, and this is something no one should really know about me,” Williams, a sophomore aerospace engineering major, said. “I felt ashamed of who I was and ashamed that I wanted to come out.”\n\nWilliams isn’t alone, said Bradley Boekeloo, the University of Maryland Prevention Research Center’s director."
