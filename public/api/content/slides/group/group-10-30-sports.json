    "blurb": "It was all smiles for the Maryland women’s basketball team Tuesday night after a dominating win at  Xfinity Center against Lincoln University (Pa.) in its second and final preseason game.\n\nThe Terps were in control from the onset, scoring as many points in Tuesday’s first quarter (36) as they did in the entire first half against California University of Pennsylvania on Friday, propelling coach Brenda Frese’s squad to a 115-52 victory. With the dominant showing, Maryland concludes its preseason having outscored its Division II opponents by a combined 102 points."

    "blurb": "In the first set of Maryland volleyball’s match against Penn State on Saturday, middle blocker Rainelle Jones left the contest with a dislocated right index finger. While her production was limited the rest of the way, seeing her back on the court in the second set was a promising sign for her teammates.\n\nThe Terps were already depleted at middle blocker with freshman Cara Lewis sidelined through injury. For a team with just four middle blockers on the roster to start with, mounting injuries at the position will be tough to manage."
