    "blurb": "When Kanye West tweeted in 2018 that he and Donald Trump “are both dragon energy,” he was solidified in my mind as an enigma. However elusive or controversial, Kanye has always been undeniably himself. In Jesus Is King, he defines his gospel-following brand but fails to delve deep enough into his own Christian enlightenment."

    "blurb": "Whenever I listen to an album for the first time, I listen from start to finish: no shuffling, no interruption, only pausing to check the name of songs that stand above the rest. Most of the time, it doesn’t really matter, but I would hate to miss any interesting transitions or subtle storytelling throughout the album.\n\nThe new Rex Orange County album, Pony, finally makes this weird ritual of mine pay off. The album, which came out Friday, took me on a fun journey from start to finish. It felt like a walk in the park."
